			<h2> Outdoor Yoga</h2>
			<div class="wrap-contact">
				<p>Within the confines of a studio, yoga teachers do their best to create an ambience of soft lights and pleasant sounds, and even an aromatic experience. But striking a mood is perhaps just an attempt to evoke a natural settingâ€”the great outdoors. Why settle for a replica of natural surroundings when you can have the real thing? Taking your class outdoors can be just what you need to invigorate your class and pluck students out of a stale studio routine, especially if they've been loyally attending your class through the winter months.</p>
